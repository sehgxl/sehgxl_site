Forcing to memorise stuff always bugged me. My mind rejects it like a child rejects eating something which it does not like or probably when he or she is full.

Many people think memorisation is learning and the memorizoor is a smart-ass. In India, there is a show called KBC. The premise is simple. You answer the que and you win money. As you keep on answering, the price also keeps getting big. All the questions are just like this. They all are kind of googlable. I mean, yea you need to think, of course no doubt about it. It's like making a soup out of facts in your head. If you got the right fact-griedients and you put them sort of in a correct order, you get the answer-soup so to speak.

But there is a different frame of learning too. In which you don't memorise raw facts. In fact it is the reverse. You do anti-memorising. The main game is trying to "understand" stuff.

There gotta be a time when you were studying something and you experience an aha moment. You sort of see something, in-fact something more clearly than before. Not in the physical space but in the abstract space. You felt, what understanding something feels like.

The more you understand something the less you have to memorise it. Meaning if you see all the nuts and bolts of an idea, concept or whatever. It will be easier for you to create it whenever you need it versus to memorise the raw idea. It is building the idea on spot versus pulling it from the memory.

There are lot of youtube videos explaining many different learning methods. So many how-tos on how to remember what you read. This is boring. Approaching learning or reading is boring like this. The less wrong way is to just cruise around whatever you find interesting. And don't take the load of if you remember whatever you read or not. Probably it was not useful for your given life context(how old are you, what you do etc etc). I am not saying it was not valuable. It was just not useful for your given context. You will "remember" only the stuff you find useful.
